Check to be sure that the non-constant format string passed as argument 2 to
this function call does not come from an untrusted source that could have added
formatting characters that the code is not prepared to handle.

Extra care should be taken to ensure that character arrays that are allocated
on the stack are used safely.  They are prime targets for buffer overflow
attacks.

src//check.c:526: High: strcpy
Check to be sure that argument 2 passed to this function call will not copy
more data than can be handled, resulting in a buffer overflow.

src//check.c:527: High: strcat
Check to be sure that argument 2 passed to this function call will not copy
more data than can be handled, resulting in a buffer overflow.

src//generate.c:56: Medium: read
Check buffer boundaries if calling this function in a loop
and make sure you are not in danger of writing past the allocated space.
