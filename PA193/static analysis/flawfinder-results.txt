FINAL RESULTS:

C:\Users\Terko\Desktop\libpwquality-master\src\check.c:526:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).

  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or

  force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move things
  around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its
